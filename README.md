# SFML_graphs (interactive graph editor)
## Why bother
I wrote that for fun & excerise. 
## What You Can Do
Draw cool graphs (of course),

Execute simple algorithms.
### Features:
- Add a vertex (Z to enter mode)
- Remove a vertex or edge (X to enter mode)
- Remove all selected vertices (R)
- Select a vertex (C to enter mode)
- Move a vertex (V + Drag desired vertex)
- Add edges from all selected vertices to the target vertex (Select desired vertices then 'A' and finally click on the target)
- Select all vertices (S)
- Unselect all vertices (U)
- Breadth First Search (with step-by-step available) (B to enter mode) 
- Dept First Search (D)
## What You Can't Do (Yet)
Save or load a graph from file.

Execute fun algorithms.
